# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April - August 2022

**Progress Thus Far**: I've been coding on and off since high school, however there have been two main periods of critical learning for me so far - early quarantine 2020 and this summer 2022. I'm starting the 100 Days of Code to hold myself accountable to learning as I head into my last two semesters of grad school. Lately, as I've started to tackle more complex projects and technologies, I can feel my progress slowing, so my hope is that this journey will keep that progress steady. 

I currently work in IT part-time, as well as part-time in my local Guitar Center, while I finish my M.A. in Philosophy. I'm hoping to find at least an hour in the mornings to code, if not between work and classes. Something that I hope to be better able to articulate by the end of this is the unique advantages I have in approaching SWE from a background in Philosophy. Not only have I studied 20th Century Analytic philosophy, a tradition that engendered the foundations of Comp Sci (See: Frege, Russell, Turing, etc.), but the incredibly dense readings have forced me to learn to take in high volumes of complex information and digest it considerably fast. While deep understanding takes several read-throughs, having this ability to quickly survey readings like this has been incredibly helpful in reading code, documentation, etc..

As of right now, I have certificates from freeCodeCamp and Codecademy in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Design, and the Fundamentals of Coding. I've also passed assessments on Linkedin and HackerRank in CSS, HTML, and Front-End Development. By the end of this journey, it would be nice to have more to show for all the time put in, however I'm much more concerned with understanding the concepts that getting the certificates. One of my troubles so far has been applying for Junior Roles and either getting nothing back or a template rejection email - so more projects, certificates, etc. in addition to being better able to advocate for my past experiences in Philosophy, education, communication, etc. is a big goal of mine.

**Goals**: In addition to what's written above, my goal by the end of these 100 days is to be able to take a concept to fruition from start to finish. It doesn't have to be market-ready, but I would like to understand all layers of the process. I've already had extensive experience with HTML/CSS and a good deal of experience with JavaScript, however I would like more experience with their frameworks. I've made a few React apps, including my portfolio site (michaellegere.com), however I would like to better understand state, routing, etc.. I would also like to gain experience with Vue, Angular, and React Native.

I do have experience with other front-end libraries and tools such as SASS, Tailwind, Bootstrap, and MUI, however I would like to have more to show for this. I may dedicate 4-5 of these 100 days to making a folder of as many well-designed landing sites as I can using these tools in different combinations. While this wouldn't require much learning, it would require making as much of the front-end process second-nature as I can.

To this effect, I would also like to practice some of the skills outside of coding, such as design and all that process entails. I've done some wireframing and some work on Figma + Canva, however I would like to refine these skills to something I could use in professional work. I am already confident in my abilities to write and communicate outside of coding, but having that better documented in wireframes, mock-ups, READMEs, etc. would much better display my abilities.

The next area I would like to gain more experience with is back-end and databases. I have some experience with SQL and Python, however I would like to be able to read and write code using technologies such as Django, Express, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.. While my strengths are currently in front-end design/implemenation, I would like to eventually be comfortable with the back-end and be able to work in Full Stack development. Since this is where I have the least experience, I may dedicate a significant portion of this journey to back-end development.

A more passive goal that would be nice to get to would be working with CMSs and templating. A lot of job listings I see require Wordpress and similar services, so touching on this would be helpful, but I don't think it's a particularly high priority goal.

Lastly, I would like to, in the end, have projects that reflect myself and my larger goals. This includes web apps that connect people with their communities - be it tracking the MBTA, finding nearby restrooms, find LGBTQ+ friendly places, etc., I want to build apps that help communities grow stronger.

If you've made it this far, thanks for reading! I hope you enjoy seeing my progress as much as I've enjoyed learning. Happy Coding!
